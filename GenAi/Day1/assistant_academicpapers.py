# Scenario: Research Assistant for Academic Papers
# Imagine you’re building a tool for university researchers who analyze large collections of academic papers.
# - A researcher uploads a sentence:
# “Deep learning models are powerful”
# - Your system uses the BERT tokenizer to break the sentence into smaller units (tokens).

from transformers import AutoTokenizer

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")

text = "Deep learning models are powerful"

tokens = tokenizer.tokenize(text)

print(tokens)
